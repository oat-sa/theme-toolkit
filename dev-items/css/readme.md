Please compile your scss files here.

For best results, the SDK folder structure should be left untouched. 
That means that on compiling, it should produce a similar tree:

/css
 |_ /themes
     |_ /items
         |_ /themeId1
             |_ theme.css
             |_ theme.css.map
         |_ /themeId2
             |_ theme.css
             |_ theme.css.map
         |_ etc.
     |_ /platform
         |_ /themeId1
             |_ theme.css
             |_ theme.css.map
         |_ etc. 
         
NB: platform themes, if you have any, will be ignored.
