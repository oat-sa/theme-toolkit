Istok is a new sans serif typeface. At present it has the four fonts with
support for Latin and Cyrillic. Most glyphs are manually instructed
using xgridfit but other ones are autoinstructed in fontforge.

The fonts are distributed under the terms of Open Font License or GNU
General Public License Version 3 with the following exception:

As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this font,
and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the
document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to
be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered
by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may
extend this exception to your version of the font, but you are not
obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
statement from your version.

The font sources have only GNU General Public License Version 3.
The sources and truetype fonts are available at
http://code.google.com/p/istok/
Tarballs are compressed with xz (http://tukaani.org/xz/).

Build and install instructions
==============================

You need fontforge (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/), TTX/FontTools
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/), xgridfit
(http://xgridfit.sourceforge.net/ - version as of April 2010) and
font-helpers (http://code.google.com/p/font-helpers/ ) in order to build
the truetype fonts from the sources. Also you should have the GNU make and
coreutils. At first you must unpack/copy the files from font-helpers into
the directory where *.sfd files are located. Then type

make

and the truetype fonts will be produced. On systems with X.Org you may do

make install

as root to install the fonts system-wide (/usr/share/fonts/TTF). Otherwise
copy the *.ttf files into the ~/.fonts/ directory. Then run fc-cache if you have
fontconfig.

The history of the font
=======================

The modified version of the CM Bright font was used for design of several
letters as raw material, other charaters are designed from scratch.
